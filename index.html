            <p>
                My hobby is playing different games usually alone because I have no friends :(, anyways I really like to when I get the chance. I try to do it every once and a while but it's hard when you have parents who don't approve video games even though I do coding to make video games so it makes no sense. Anyway I got this because everyone was playing them so I thought I'd try them and I instantly fell in love with the only video game at the time that was really played by girls which is Roblox and up to this date I still play it. But now I play more games then just roblox I play Among Us, Dragon City, Goozy and more. I feel like video games aren't bad but way too adicting but I still will play them because they give us some creativity which I think is really important to everybody.

        <h3>Roblox</h3>
        <p> So roblox is a game with many little games inside of them and is downloadable on any device. This game first went popular with little girls then later people decided that it was cool for all ages and became a game that almost all youtube gamers played and was extremely popular. So if you're playing mobile then there is a jump button and a circle with another circle inside of it, move that circle around and you will be moving the jump button will make you jump. But if you're playing PC or Macc or some type of computer, the space bar with allow you to jump as the "W" key with make you move forward. The "A" key with make you move left and the "D" key will make you move right, the "S" key with make you move downward or backward. A little trick for those wo are playing computer if you press shift them when you move your camera, usually the character would not move the way it's facing but if you use shift lock the character with move as to where your camera is facing. I think roblox is a good game and gives children some creativity as you can also make your own game in roblox if you have permission from the owner/creator of roblox, and I love how you can friend your friends and join their game as well as chat with them right on Roblox.</p>

        <h3>Among Us</h3>
        <p> Among Us is very popular at the moment. This game is downloadable on any device, but on mobile it's free as for computer it's a small amount but you still have to pay. If you're playing mobile then it's the same moving thing as the roblox mobile except there is no jump key. On computer you move your coursor to move your own self and everything else is pretty easy to learn like how to do the tasks and how to kill people when you're imposter. I think Among Us is pretty fun as you do your own tasks you vote people out and you can play with your friends by joining their game with a code at the bottom of the screen.</p>

        <p>Five Night's At Freddy's</p>

        <p>Five Night's At Freddy's also known as FNaF is a horror game that is avalible on all devices. I do not know for sure how to play like the how to control but I do know how to play (kinda). In this game there are 5 main characters that go after you. There are cameras that you have to look at, and when one of the 5 characters are close to the door or in the end vent there is a button that you have to press if you don't want to get jump scared and redo that entire night. Oh I forgot to mention that you a nightgaurd and the animatronics are trying to jump scare you as well as kill you. By the way the 5 characters are Freddy Fazbear,Bonnie,Chica,Foxy, and Golden Freddy. There is another character named Endo-01 but I have never seen him so he's not really a worry. You must continue this untill 6:00 AM once it strikes 6 your shift is over but you have to come back again the next night (unless it's night 5 you just beat). Oh I probably should've told you this before You have limited power with mean you can't use the camera or keep the door shut the entire time or you will loose power and the closest animatronic will come runing a jumpscare you because when you loose power the doors automaticly open and you can't close them. There are many games of FNaF but they are all the same except each one gets harder and harder and more things you have to do to survive and more characters but more of them are based off each other.</p>

        <p> This is not all the games that exist I just named and explained a few.
